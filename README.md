# csc675-fa18-database

The goal of this project was to create a business rating and review forum that consumers could use
to view other people's experiences and the reviews they have written for a given business.  

This project's purpose was to showcase the various SQL queries that can be made on a database to return the desired results.
The process of designing the database, including the first draft of the ER Diagram and the constraints the system would have, can be seen
in the files within the img and pdf folders.   
The project was completed with the help of one other person (in pdf files). 

_All the SQL, including queries, is in a single file_
